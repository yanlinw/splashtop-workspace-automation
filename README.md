# Splashtop Secure Workspace Automation

Splashtop Secure Workspace provides a rich set of APIs with full automation capability for managing and working within the workspace. The secure workspace offers IT administrators and end users an all-in-one platform to access their applications and data, making it crucial to automate the provisioning of the workspace and its applications. The automation capability empowers IT admins, developers, and end users with unprecedented flexibility to manage and work within the workspace. Some examples include:

- IT admins can automate the provisioning of the workspace and applications for end users.
- Developers can automate and orchestrate their geo-distributed applications using a single piece of code.
- End users can automate their daily tasks within the workspace.
- System admins can automate the network configuration within the workspace.
